Group Assignment Repo for Collaboboration Purposes 
1.For our oroject we firt understood the problem that we got.We than decided to come up with the application 
which is used by the customers aswell as by the employees of Ayesha Beauty for their daily operations.
Our application have different modules and different functions;Sales, Account,Clients,Products
 and Employees.However due to the limitations of the primitive platform given  it became 
challenging to establish all the required functionality oif this application. The application
 is mostly implimimnted using conditional loops to crrate fumctions and procedures. 
While some return value, some are mere and hold value only on extecucation.

Further more the application was impliment with a GUI interface to enhence easy usage and remove 
exuctional complexities as it it is toi be used by low level operators. We tried having a secure programming
 concept implimented so we protect all sensitivr data from illegal access, a level-3 user is limited
 to certain executions, while all users with admin rights can entirely manipulate the apllication
 in any manner. Hving access to all modules and functions and commit to tasks.

	BELLOW IS A LIST OF MOST OF THE FUNCTIONAL  MODULE, PROCEDURS AND FUNCTIONS.
(note that due to the limitation of the provide IDE platform, this methods appear as primitive as they can be 
traced back to actual graphic interface)

The following Sprites carry functions and modules. please view code for more details:
:: Register
:: Login
:: CLients
::Employees
:: Sales
::Products
::Accounts


    Register: This is a function that allows authorized users to add new system users. 
              It contains lists and variables that store data captured from the user    
             interface. More of this can be experienced while interacting with the system.
    Login: While this procedure makes reference to stored data from the above function.
           it can't be a function as it does not retain any data. However it returns error
             messages when wrong credentials are acaptured.
     Clients: This fucntion/module exhibits both traits of a procedure and a function.
               Running the function gives you two options.One to retrunvalues when requesting to view 
              existing clients and the other one allows you with ad,in rights to register new clients.
    Employees:This fucntion/module exhibits both traits of a procedure and a function.
               Running the function gives you two options.One to retrunvalues when requesting to view 
              existing employees and the other one allows you with ad,in rights to register new employees.
    Sales: This function allows users to execute transactions and returns values, for example your change
            is a returned value. Furthermore it captures data from the user interaction and stores it to database of lists,
             due to the software limitations.
// This is mainly the functionality and purpose of this application.
