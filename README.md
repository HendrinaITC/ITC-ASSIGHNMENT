Group Assignment Repo for Collaboboration Purposes 
1.For our oroject we firt understood the problem that we got.We than decided to come up with the application which is used by the customers aswell as by the employees of Ayesha Beauty for their daily operations.Our application have different modules and different functions;Sales, Account,Clients,Products and Employees.

For the Sales it takes the employees and clients to see the prices and to enable empyoyees to sell the product and for clients to buy products or order.
Account allows employees to get access files of certain things or operations.

Clients enables clients to create their account on the Ayesha Beauty app,so that if customer wants to buy or order a certain product they wont have a long process of getting it.

Products to enable employees to see what products they have in stock and also to enable them to see when the expiry date of a product is(to see or check when the product is expiring).

Employees gives us access to employee details.Enables us to get access to the names of the employees who are available and those that are not available ,also allows enployees to get access to client information.
